## 🧬 About Me

I am a **Bioinformatics graduate** currently working as a **Bioinformatics Intern at Vizzhy**.  
My background is rooted in **bioinformatics**, and I am gradually strengthening my computational skills through hands-on projects and real-world omics datasets.

I completed my **M.Sc. in Bioinformatics (CGPA: 8.93)** and moved directly into industry to understand how biological data is **analyzed, validated, and reported** beyond academic settings.

> I care deeply about clarity, reproducibility, and honest scientific work.

## 🌿 Current Role

### 🧬 Bioinformatics Intern — **Vizzhy**
📅 *Oct 2025 – Present*

At Vizzhy, I am learning how bioinformatics workflows operate in practice, beyond coursework and tutorials.

**My work involves:**
- 🧪 Working with real-world omics datasets  
- 🔁 Supporting end-to-end analysis workflows  
- 🧬 Exposure to genomics and lipidomics data  
- 🗂 Organizing intermediate and final results for traceability  
- 📝 Assisting with validation, documentation, and reporting  

This role is helping me connect **academic bioinformatics concepts with applied industry workflows**.
