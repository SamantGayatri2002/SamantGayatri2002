## 🧬 About Me

I am a **Bioinformatics Intern**, with a strong academic foundation and growing industry exposure.  
My journey began in **Bioinformatics**, not computational biology, and I am steadily expanding my computational skills through real datasets and applied projects.

I completed my **M.Sc. in Bioinformatics (CGPA: 8.93)** and transitioned directly into my **first professional role** as a **Bioinformatics Intern at Vizzhy**, where I am gaining hands-on experience with real-world omics data and reporting practices.

> I value clarity, reproducibility, and honest representation of scientific work.

## 🌿 Current Role

### 🧬 Bioinformatics Intern — **Vizzhy**  
📅 *Oct 2025 – Present*  
📌 *First professional role after graduation*

At Vizzhy, I am learning how bioinformatics is applied in an industry setting, beyond academic coursework.

**My work involves:**
- Understanding and handling **real biological datasets**
- Supporting **end-to-end omics analysis workflows**
- Working with **genomics and lipidomics data**
- Organizing **intermediate and final result files** for traceability
- Assisting with **data validation and scientific reporting**
- Learning best practices for **workflow documentation and reproducibility**

This role is helping me bridge **academic bioinformatics knowledge with applied industry expectations**.
